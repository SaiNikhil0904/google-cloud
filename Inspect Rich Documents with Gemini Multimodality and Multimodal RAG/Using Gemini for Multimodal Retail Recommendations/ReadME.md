# Using Gemini for Multimodal Retail Recommendations

## Overview

This notebook guides you through creating a **retail recommendation system** using the **multimodal abilities** of Gemini in **Vertex AI**. The system takes both **product images** and **customer input** (like preferences or queries) to deliver personalized product suggestions.

## What You’ll Learn

* Set up and use the **Gemini multimodal model** on Vertex AI.
* Send both **text and image inputs** to the model.
* Generate **smart retail recommendations** using combined data.
* Understand how to apply this in **real-world e-commerce personalization**.

## Tasks

1. Configure **Vertex AI** with your Google Cloud project ID and region.
2. Load the Gemini model: `gemini-1.0-pro-vision`.
3. Provide a **product image** (e.g., a shoe) and a **customer request** like:
   *“I want something similar in black with better grip.”*
4. Display the **AI’s recommendation** based on the combined input.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you’ll be able to:

* Use **image + text** together for more accurate, tailored recommendations.
* See how Gemini can understand and respond to **visual and written customer needs**.
* Build a foundation for creating **AI-powered retail solutions** on Vertex AI.
