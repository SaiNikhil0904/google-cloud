    "While online (synchronous) responses limits you to one input request at a time, [batch predictions for the Gemini API in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/batch-prediction-gemini) allow you to send a large number of requests to Gemini in a single batch request. Then, the model responses asynchronously populate to your storage output location in [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction) or [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/storage_overview).\n",
